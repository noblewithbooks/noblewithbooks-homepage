    <div class="ebook-panel">

      <p>
        This book describes a thinking trip that Pinocchio, a fifth-grade
        elementary school student, takes with a fairy believed to exist only in
        our imagination. Pinocchio meets a fairy wearing a green cone-shaped hat
        and embarks on seven journeys over seven days. The story unfolds across
        two worlds: the real world and the imaginary world. Inspired deeply by
        Hermann Hesse during her adolescence, the author borrows the framework of
        the dual worlds from <em>Demian</em> as an homage to Hesse’s novel.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the thinking journey with the fairy, Pinocchio reflects on his own
        questions through inquiry and dialogue, reminiscent of the Socratic
        method. On the first day, he travels through the imaginary world and
        discusses the works of surrealist painters such as Salvador Dalí. On the
        second day, he explores the theme “different is not wrong,” which forms
        the core message of this book. On the third day, he reflects on what is
        truly precious in life. On the fourth day, he encounters Hermann Hesse
        and discusses <em>The Glass Bead Game</em>, gradually finding answers to
        his own questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the fifth day, Pinocchio and the fairy contemplate birth and death as
        two sides of the same coin. On the sixth day, he is invited to an
        underground festival where he meets the Goddess Gaia and continues his
        search for meaning. Finally, on the seventh day, Pinocchio arrives at an
        ultimate conclusion encompassing all of his questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>A Thinking Trip with Pinocchio</em> is structured as seven journeys
        over seven days, each centered on a single question. At the end of each
        day’s journey, a “ring of thinking” — a concise sentence connecting the
        question and its answer — is presented in a witty, poetic form
        reminiscent of children’s verse. This structure encourages readers to
        pause and reflect on the questions and insights they might otherwise
        overlook.
      </p>

      <p>
        The repeated practice of forming these “rings of thinking,” introduced
        with the phrase “thoughts follow one after another,” continues through
        all seven chapters. As readers grow familiar with the pattern of “Oh,
        that?” followed by a poetic answer, they naturally begin to cultivate
        their own way of thinking. The book is further enriched by distinctive
        illustrations that enhance the imaginative journey, including
        appearances by philosophers such as Nietzsche and Chuang-tzu.
