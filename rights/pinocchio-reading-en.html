    <div class="ebook-panel">

      <p>
  As it is said in ‘To all the Pinocchios in the world’, which appears on the
  dedication page of each book in the Pinocchio series published by Noble with
  Books, reading in one’s childhood has a greater impact than reading a book as
  an adult in one’s life. Books read during childhood can determine a person’s
  future.
</p>

<p>
  What books one reads and what one thinks can determine a person’s life. What
  kind of books you read during your elementary school years determines what
  kind of compass you have in your journey over the sea of life. Having the
  right compass is the only way to lead a right life.
</p>

<p>
  This book helps you learn the important meaning of “thinking” in life through
  a reading game. And it makes you realize that books and thoughts are like soul
  mates. Also, if you become close with books when you are in elementary school,
  you will find that you can have a best friend who will protect you for the rest
  of your life, which will bring books even closer.
</p>

  <p>
  This book will guide our children on the path to becoming a reading master and
  teach them how to enjoy reading as a game.
  </p>

  <p>
  The main character of this book, Pinocchio, is in the fifth grade of elementary
  school. Pinocchio doesn’t particularly dislike reading books, but he struggles
  with reading, like a person stuck in a maze. He often finds it difficult to
  express his thoughts after reading a book.
  </p>

  <p>
  Like Pinocchio, many children in Korea also have no fun reading books, and they
  have a hard time expressing their thoughts after reading one.
  </p>

  <p>
  The reason is because they think that reading is connected to studying. So, if
  you change the circuitry of your brain to think that reading is not like
  studying, but like a game, you will open your eyes anew to reading. And, as an
  added bonus, you learn that this thought is the key to changing everything. In
  addition, fun pictures are also included to help enrich children’s
  imagination.
