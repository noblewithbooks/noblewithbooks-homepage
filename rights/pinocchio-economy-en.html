  <p>
    <strong>A child with a sense of economy grows into an adult who realizes his or her dreams.</strong>
    <em>Pinocchio, Let’s Go on a Trip with Economy</em> explains fundamental economic principles
    through a fairytale, inviting children to approach the concept of money in an easy
    and engaging way.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the story, Pinocchio, the young protagonist, one day discovers a pair of ruby shoes
    that he desperately wants. However, he soon realizes that his family cannot afford them.
    Faced with this reality, Pinocchio unexpectedly finds a way forward and sets out on a
    journey. During his travels, he meets various people, encounters different situations,
    and gradually develops a sense of economy that he had not yet possessed.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the epilogue, the author explains why she decided to write this story. As a child,
    she once wondered about her family’s economic situation — whether they were rich,
    average, or poor — because she wanted to understand, from her own perspective, why
    her mother could not buy her certain toys. Yet, adults never explained it to her.
    They simply told her to endure.
  </p>

  <p>
    This book begins from the belief that children no longer need to endure without
    understanding. Through <em>Pinocchio, Let’s Go on a Trip with Economy</em>, children can
    naturally learn the concepts of money and basic economic principles in an accessible
    and enjoyable way.
  </p>

  <p>
    The author further reflects on her experience as a parent. Explaining money to her own
    child was not easy, and she often worried whether teaching economic concepts might cause
    her child to lose innocence. This book is the result of those 고민과 사유 — written with
    the hope of helping children develop a healthy sense of economy while preserving their
    sense of wonder.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through Pinocchio’s exciting journey, children learn practical ideas such as recording
    their spending, understanding how banks work, and using money responsibly. The book
    offers a meaningful solution for parents and educators who struggle to explain economic
    concepts to children.
  </p>

  <p>
    Designed for both children and adults, this book encourages discussion at home and in
    the classroom. Vivid and creative illustrations stimulate the imagination, making the
    journey with Pinocchio even more engaging and joyful. Readers may feel both emotional
    resonance and the pleasure of learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the end of the book, children, parents, and teachers alike can share precious and
    happy memories — discovering together that learning about money can be thoughtful,
    warm, and meaningful.
