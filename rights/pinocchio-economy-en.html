    <div class="ebook-panel">

  <p>
  <strong>A child with a sense of economy grows as an adult who realizes his/her dream.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  This book explains economic principles in the form of a fairytale to promote children's
  interest in economy. In the story, Pinocchio, our hero, finds a pair of ruby shoes one day.
  He really wants to get the shoes, but realizes that he cannot buy them because his family
  does not have enough money. However, he unexpectedly finds a way to have the ruby shoes,
  and goes on a trip. During traveling, he meets many people, has various experiences, and
  nurtures his sense of economy that he has yet to have.
</p>

<p>
  The author tells the reason why she wrote this story in the epilogue.
</p>

<p>
  “When I was a child, I wondered which class my family was in. I wanted to know whether we
  were rich or medium or poor. It was because I wanted to understand the reason why Mom could
  not buy me a toy from my own view of the world. However, grown-ups did not explain it to me.
  They just said I had to endure.”
</p>

<p>
  Now, children don't have to endure any more. It is because they can learn the concept of
  money and economic law easily and interestingly from <em>Pinocchio, Let's Go on a Trip with
  Economy</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Then she goes on to explain as follows.
</p>

<p>
  “But now that I have become a parent, it was not easy to explain the concept of money to my
  child. It was difficult to find where I begin, and I also had a concern: ‘what if my child
  would lose the innocence as a child?’ This book is a product of the agonies of mine. I wrote
  this book in the hope of helping children growing a sense of economy. Reading the exciting
  travel stories, children can easily learn how to keep a record of their spending and how to
  use a bank.”
</p>

<p>
  This book can be a great solution for parents who have found difficulty in teaching their
  children the concept of money. With this book, children may grow economic sense without
  losing their childhood sense of wonder. This is good to read for kids and their parents as
  well. In addition, this is also good for kids and teachers to have discussions in the
  classroom.
</p>

<p>
  Creative illustrations that beautifully stimulate your imagination make your trip with
  Pinocchio even more exciting and happier. You may feel touched and experience the joy of
  learning as well.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of this book, mother, father, children, and teacher could share precious happy
  memories together.
