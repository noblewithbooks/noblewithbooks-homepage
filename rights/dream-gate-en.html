  <p>
    This book describes a thinking trip that Pinocchio, a fifth-grade elementary
    school student, takes with a fairy believed to exist only in our imagination.
    Pinocchio meets a fairy wearing a green cone-shaped hat and embarks on seven
    journeys over seven days. The story unfolds across two worlds: the real world
    and the imaginary world. Inspired deeply by Hermann Hesse during her
    adolescence, the author borrows the framework of the dual worlds from
    <em>Demian</em> as an homage to Hesse’s novel.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the thinking journey with the fairy, Pinocchio reflects on his own
    questions through inquiry and dialogue, reminiscent of the Socratic method.
    On the first day, he travels through the imaginary world and discusses the
    works of surrealist painters such as Salvador Dalí. On the second day, he
    explores the theme “different is not wrong,” which forms the core message of
    this book. On the third day, he reflects on what is truly precious in life.
    On the fourth day, he encounters Hermann Hesse and discusses
    <em>The Glass Bead Game</em>, gradually finding answers to his own questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the fifth day, Pinocchio and the fairy contemplate birth and death as two
    sides of the same coin. On the sixth day, he is invited to an underground
    festival where he meets the Goddess Gaia and continues his search for
    meaning. Finally, on the seventh day, Pinocchio arrives at an ultimate
    conclusion encompassing all of his questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>A Thinking Trip with Pinocchio</em> is structured as seven journeys over
    seven days, each centered on a single question. At the end of each day’s
    journey, a “ring of thinking” — a concise sentence connecting the question
    and its answer — is presented in a witty, poetic form reminiscent of
    children’s verse. This structure encourages readers to pause and reflect on
    the questions and insights they might otherwise overlook.
  </p>

  <p>
    The repeated practice of forming these “rings of thinking,” introduced with
    the phrase “thoughts follow one after another,” continues through all seven
    chapters. As readers grow familiar with the pattern of “Oh, that?” followed
    by a poetic answer, they naturally begin to cultivate their own way of
    thinking. The book is further enriched by distinctive illustrations that
    enhance the imaginative journey, including appearances by philosophers such
    as Nietzsche and Chuang-tzu.
