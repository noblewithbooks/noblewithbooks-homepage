 <p>
  <strong>A humanities book that helps teenagers develop their thinking skills.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  In Seong, the hero of <em>Humanities in My Hand: The Gate of Dream</em>, is a first-grade
  middle school student. However, physical age does not matter—any reader can be In Seong.
  Most adults have passed through the first year of middle school, some teenage readers are
  exactly In Seong’s age, and children will reach it in the future. In this sense, the author
  says in the epilogue that we are all In Seong.
</p>

<p>
  Various gatekeepers appear throughout the book: Eastern philosophers such as Chuang-tzu and
  Lao-tzu; Western philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Nietzsche; scientists such as
  Galileo Galilei; explorers such as Columbus; and even fairytale characters such as Alice and
  Oz. Here, philosophers are not distant figures speaking difficult metaphysical terms, but
  neighbors who share casual conversations with In Seong.
</p>

<p>
  This book never attempts to infuse philosophical terms or concepts into the reader. With no
  information-heavy explanations, there is nothing to memorize. Instead, through thinking
  patterns shaped by both emotion and logic—drawn from the history of Western philosophy—the
  book helps readers build a thinking system and fill their own “thinking drawer.”
</p>

<p>
  In addition, the book raises fundamental questions about human existence—for example,
  “Who are we?”—and persistently searches for answers. This reflects the portrait of ourselves
  embodied by In Seong. In this regard, the book is not only recommended for teenagers but
  also meaningful for grown-ups who have yet to find where they are going.
</p>

<p>
  The author also writes in the prologue:
</p>

<p>
  “This book has a motto like this: a philosophy book for teenagers, which is also good to
  read for adults. We guess that adults know better than teenagers. However, this may not be
  the case for philosophy. Particularly in Korea, teenagers read more than adults because of
  several realistic circumstances. Therefore, it cannot be said that grown-ups are more
  knowledgeable about philosophy. Rather, grown-ups may have more preconceptions about it. I
  hope that grown-ups treat humanities without prejudice like teenagers do. In this regard,
  this book is a required reading for not only adults but also teenagers.”
