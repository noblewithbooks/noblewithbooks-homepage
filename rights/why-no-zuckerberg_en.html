  <p>
  <strong>A child with a sense of economy grows as an adult who realizes his/her dream.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Nowadays, it is said that today's Korean teenagers want to be a civil servant or a landlord. The two jobs are commonly far from creating new things. In other words, teenagers reflect adults' stability-oriented mindset. This means that Korean youngsters give up enterprising spirits early in their lives. When the younger generation chooses to settle for stable life instead of challenge, this poses a danger signal to the future of Korean society.
</p>

<p>
  The author published this book in the hope that there appear many young entrepreneurs who start their own business with creative ideas like Mark Elliot Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, in Korea. This book, subtitled a guide to entrepreneurship for teenagers, will encourage youngsters to have dream and hope for creating their own enterprise. In addition, it helps them growing a sense of reality by providing realistic information on venture businesses.
</p>

<p>
  The author hopes that this book weaved in the form of interesting stories will encourages teenagers to restore their weakened enterprising spirit and dream.
</p>

<p>
  Mun Seongcheul, the author of this book, studied Business Management in Yonsei University, dreaminig of creating his own business. In addition to the lectures at school, he participated in many lectures and seminars on new businesses to prepare his own business. He worked in a business development team of a corporation, where a TV show titled Misaeng was filmmed, and started two companies and managed them. Based on these experiences, he wrote this book to provide teenagers with wisdom for creating a business.
</p>

<p>
  He says as follows in Author's Note in this book: "Why Is There No Zuckerberg in Korea? This was the question that drove me to write this book. Although young people in Korea have dreams, talents, and willpower, there is no global figure in the field of venture enterprise. There are many Korean stars who have achieved great success globally in the sports and entertainment scenes like BTS, Kim Yuna, and b-boys. Then why is there no such a figure in the field of venture business?
</p>

<p>
  In Korea, when it comes to creating a business, it generally reminds us of opening a fried chicken restaurant or convenient store at the retirement. It implies that the category that should be the most innovative is locked in a stale, old frame. Young people must not follow the same old sterotype. They need to break the old frame for the bright future of Korea.
</p>

<p>
  Like Zuckerberg's famous words "Move fast and break things," Korean youngsters should move fast along with the global trend that changes in seconds, and break the old frame. To prepare themselves for it, Why Is There No Zuckerberg in Korea is the very book that they must read first!
</p>

<p>
  Why Is There No Zuckerberg in Korea is not a boring theoretical book on venture business but an intriguing story book about time travel. Eye-catching illustrations add more charm to the already exciting story.
