  <div class="ebook-panel">

<p>
  <strong>
    This book is a philosophical travel essay centered on a journey to locate the
    original Dolharubang statues scattered across Jeju Island.
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  The author sets out to trace 47 surviving original Dolharubang figures—statues whose
  existence remains largely unknown even among local residents—and records their
  forms, locations, and significance through photographs and reflective prose.
</p>

<p>
  While most people are familiar only with the iconic wide-eyed Dolharubang commonly
  reproduced in tourist imagery, this book reveals the wide diversity of their
  original appearances and challenges the simplified image that has become dominant.
</p>

<p>
  The journey described here is not only physical but also inward. As the author
  travels across Jeju Island, she poses questions about life, identity, and direction
  to the Dolharubang, transforming travel itself into a process of self-examination.
</p>

<p>
  Drawing on the philosophical distinction between originals and copies—most notably
  Plato’s theory of forms—the narrative interweaves travel, reflection, and philosophy,
  shaping what the author describes as a “thinking travel essay.”
</p>

<p>
  Rather than listing popular restaurants or cafés, the book invites readers to
  encounter the quieter layers of Jeju Island: its landscapes, its history, and its
  understated emotional depth. By the final page, a lingering question naturally
  remains—can we truly reach the essence of a place, and of ourselves?

  <p>
  Sunwoo Cho moved to Jeju Island during the COVID-19 pandemic and lived there for two years.
  While in Jeju, she happened to learn that original Dolharubang statues exist separately from
  the commonly known forms, and she wrote this book while traveling across the island in search
  of those original Dolharubang figures. She became deeply engaged in photography in Jeju and,
  while experimenting with life as a “digital nomad,” is embracing a new chapter in her life
  as a travel writer.
</p>

<p>
  Previously, she majored in philosophy at university and obtained a Level 2 secondary school
  teaching certificate as an additional qualification. She then worked as a planner and
  copywriter at an advertising agency, and later as a journalist for <em>Education News</em>,
  an education-focused newspaper, where she was accredited to the Seoul Metropolitan Office
  of Education. After working as an editor and planner in the publishing industry, she began
  her career in February 2012 as the representative and an author of Noblewithbooks.
</p>

<p>
  Her published works include <em>Humanities in My Hand: The Gate of Dream (A Philosophy Classroom for Adolescents)</em>,
  <em>I Am an Indigo Child (A Thinking Classroom for Adolescents)</em>,
  <em>A Journey of Thought with Pinocchio</em>,
  <em>Reading Expedition with Pinocchio</em>,
  <em>How Do We Become Book Sommeliers?</em>,
  <em>Pattern Recognition Reading (with the History of Western Philosophy)</em>,
  <em>For Those Who Wish to Publish</em>, and <em>Bold Dream Interpretation</em>.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Humanities in My Hand: The Gate of Dream</em> was selected as a recommended book by Chaiktase
  (Teachers Who Create a Warm World Through Books) in the summer of 2018.
  <em>A Journey of Thought with Pinocchio</em> was selected for the Sejong Books (General Category)
  in 2020, and together with <em>Reading Expedition with Pinocchio</em>, it was also selected
  as a “Recommended Book” by the Korean Institute for Research in Children’s Education and Culture.
  She plans to continue her active career as an author in the years to come.
